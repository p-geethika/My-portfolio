									<h1>Quantum Computing</h1>

						<p>Now-a-days classical computing is one of the most common things for every individual. But still there are many challenges that classical computing can’t tackle those are the complex problems. To solve the complex problems quantum computing was introduced.</p>
<p>Currently the in the classical computing the information is stored and modified it is basically stored in the form of bits or binary system that is 0’s and 1’s whereas in quantum computing to do the manipulation of data qubits or quantum bits are taken into consideration. The major difference between a qubit and bits is that qubit can take several values whereas bit can only take 1’s and 0’s.</p>
<p> There are three properties of quantum world that are useful to manipulate the state of quantum computing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Superposition</li>
	<li>Entanglement</li>
	<li>Interference</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if we talk about superposition is a combination of two ordinary states that we would describe independently. for example, if we play two musical notes at the same time, we would get a new note. The number of superposition is 2^n where n is the no of qubits so one can think how faster a quantum computer can work.</p>
<p>In quantum entanglement we get a relation between their fundamental properties that can’t happen by chance like if we have a pair of gloves and we have the left glove with us whereas it is obvious that the other glove would definitely be the right one hence this is called entanglement. Entangled particles behave in such a way that their logic cannot be explained by classical computing. Einstein generally call it as a spooky action at a distance. </p>
<p>Interference can be understood using the reference of waves as if the particles are in phase, they add up an in opposite phase they cancel each other. A quantum system is extremely delicate any kind of minor disturbance may cause destruction to the system or it loses it quantum properties.</p>
<p>Quantum gate is something that changes that changes the state of the qubit.
Quantum computing can perform can perform a huge number of classical states in parallel. Quantum computing has already solved many of the crucial problems that the classical computing cannot solve like weather and climate change predictions, data security (using quantum encryption and quantum cryptography), drug research and development. etc many more. For any system there exists setbacks as well like as we know that qubit is quite sensitive to the environment, limitations of hardware. At present the best quantum computer has 50 bits. Quantum computers may whenever build will have a tight data security system even though it can break the impossible problems that a classical computer cannot do. The idea of quantum computers is to solve the unsolvable problems but not replace classical computing.</p>

<p>POWER OF QUANTUM COMPUTING<br>
1.	We can solve the science most complex and create some of the lifesaving medicines.
Radiotherapy: it is the most relevant technique that is used to treat cancer in which a beam of gamma rays is projected in the affected area and kill the cells. It is a process where it can damage the surrounding areas as well hence it inteproves to be a complex problem in itself. so, there is a possibility if we use quantum computing the stimulation of the rays can be broader this can be allowed to obtain multiple stimulation.<br>
Drug research: The major starting point of drug research is comparison of the molecules whereas in classical computers can only compare till extent .it is possible that with the help of quantum computers we can compare the larger molecules as well.<br>
2.	It can be useful to create more energy efficient materials, better weather forecasting.
This is the “4th industrial revolution” is said by Morgan Stanley.<br>
3.	Significant threat to cyber security: quantum computing algorithms may decode some of the security algorithm but instead we can shift to quantum safe encryptions.<br>
4.	With the help of deep learning quantum computers can interact with outside world.
 NOW THE QUESTION ARISES WHEN QUANTUM COMPTING CAN SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS WHY IS IT STILL NOT DISCOVERED? WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS COMING?<br></p>
<p>Even though we know the properties and theory of quantum computing it is difficult to read, write and assembling the qubit and to insert or delete the information without any uncertainty. A qubit requires no external disturbance as its superposition gets disturbed and it shows error .it also requires a low temperature. Hence, in a long run it is difficult to obey all the properties so it has not yet discovered. We even don’t know yet if it is even possible or not but a large number of engineers and scientist are involved in this process.</p>
